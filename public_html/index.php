			<h3>A Tribute To All Brown County Veteran's</h3>
			<p>Long after the victory parades and flag waving, these men and women who helped to defend our county and protected the fragile peace shall not be forgotten. Some made the ultimate sacrifice, some have given us freedom and paid for it with pain and suffering, others gave up family life or promising careers to defend us. This tribute is not to honor or glorify war, but to show appreciation to the common man and woman who rose to do the uncommon in the past, present and future.</p>
			<p>Their readiness to risk, to take a chance, the courage and the valor they displayed, the blood they shed, the lives they gave......</p>
			<p style="text-align: center; color: red; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">WE WILL REMEMBER</p>
			<p>Over 4000 Tribute bricks are currently in place. On a first come first serve basis, the remaining 3000, 4" x 8" Veterans Tribute Bricks will be located within the area inside the circular sidewalk. Additional 4" x 8", 8" x 8" and 12" x 12" Tribute bricks will be located on the approach walkway leading up to and around the memorial. Please select Brick Order Forms from the menu to print out your purchase form, thank you.</p>
